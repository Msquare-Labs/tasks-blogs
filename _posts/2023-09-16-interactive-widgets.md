# Getting Started
​
Put quite simple tasks can be broke down into the following parts
​
1. Projects
2. Tasks
3. Filters
4. Smart Lists
5. Folders
​

​
## Projects
​
Create the projects you have and you can then add tasks to them. Projects are very unique in Tasks as each proejct can have a completely custom setup. A standard project can have a simple workflow where tasks move from `Todo → Done`. Other projects can't be a more complex workflow like a `Home Renovation` project where the workflow could be as follows `Plan → Finalise → Buy → Setup → Inspect → Completed` .
​
This brings us to the parts you can customise per project:
​
- Statuses (these are the columns or your workflow)
- Tags + Priorities + Task Types
- Fields (the fields you need for capturing all the task details)
​
Let us expand on them.
​
### Statuses
​
These are nothing but the columns you see and how your tasks flow. Let us take a very basic example such as `Todo → Doing → Done` . You can edit these statuses as you like, from their color to their icon. Here is how you would do that in the app - find the project in the Home Screen of the app, long press or right click on it and select the option that reads `Modify Task Statuses`. On selecting that you'd be presented by a similar screen where you can modify them.

​
The green checkmark icon denotes the column which holds completed tasks. These tasks do not appear in the count of pending tasks of that project.
​
### Tags + Priorities + Task Types
​
There are many places to create them as you'll see when exploring the app. One of the ways is to tap on `+ Add Tags`. You can long press on the `Tags` header as you see in the screenshot below to reorganise them in an order you prefer. You can always edit or delete them by long pressing or right clicking on the tags as well.
​

​
What is the difference between tags, priorities and task types?
​
Priorities are self explanatory. A task can have multiple tags, but only **one** task type. I use them personally to describe what does the task denote, e.g, it's a bug or feature. This is how they look on tasks.

​
### Fields
​
We get it, there is no one size fits all and that is why we allow you'll to add more fields or even remove existing fields you'll do not require. We support the following fields:
​
- Text*
- Date*
- Tags*
- Task Type
- Priority
- Attachments
- Comments
- Subtasks
​
*Supports multiple of these fields
​
You can do into the task, tap on the `···` icon on the top right and tap on `Manage Fields`. You are then presented with the below screens and you can delete fields, add new ones, select your own name of the field and you're done!
​
Note: Once you create a field,  it is reflected for all tasks in **that** project. Fields are configured per project so they don't disturn your other projects with adding unneccesary fields.

# Tasks
​
We've tried our best to make this part as intuitive so there isn't much to say, but let us share a few tips and tricks.
​
When creating a task, you can naturally type in the date and we pick it up and assign that date to the task. We are working on adding support for @ and # to fill tags, priorities and assign tasks to users through just the keyboard.
​
You can always long press or right click a task and perform quick actions as shown in the images below!

​
## Filters
​
These are simple predefined filters that filter all the tasks in the app. You can tap on the `+` icon on the Home Screen and select the ones you want to see. By default you'll see a few filters to help you get started. You can hide them entirely as per your convenience.

## Smart Lists
​
I'll be honest with you, this is my favorite feature. I started developing Tasks because I needed something this. Smart Lists works as a dynamic filter that you define. Let me expand on that with an example. Say you want all high priority tasks across all your projects. It is so inconvenient to go into each project and find them and complete them, right? Smart Lists solves that and more.
​
Here is a Smart List I will create which reads as the following:
​
Find me all tasks, across all projects where the tasks `contains` priority `High` and the tasks that are assigned to me! How simple and clean right? We are working on improving this a lot more to make it even more effortless and can't wait to share that with you'll soon!

## Folders
​
Folders are just ways to organise your projects to make your Home Screen less cluttered. You can nest folders within folders, place Projects and Smart Lists within them.
​
Often users ask me how do I archive projects and for that I recommmend creating an Archived folder, and moving it to the bottom and placing the projects you want to within them.
​
I use Folders to keep my Personal, Work and Misc projects organised to avoid cluttering my Home Screen.

​
This brings me to the end of this blog post. We shall be writing up a lot more and since this is the first, let me highlight a few other points that you'd love about Tasks and we hope to cover each of them more in detail soon.
​
- Collaboration - you can invite people, assign tasks, comment, get notified and so much more.
- Search - Duh, no task app is complete without this and our search is incredibly fast, searches within fields of tasks and comments.
- Siri Shortcuts - you can totally automate things and there is a shortcut for almost everything. If we are missing any, do let us know and we turnaround really quick.
- Focus Filters - so when in Work Mode, hide all projects that are a distraction.
- Widgets - we have them everywhere in every size. They are even interactable in iOS 17. Add them to your Home Screen, Lock Screen, on your Mac, on your Watch and even on StandBy.
- URL Schemes - we support them and [here is a link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-QZFBStmwV1bjbZlOHOoeqNhJjrL4WPj/view?usp=share_link) to how you can use them.
- Watch app - with watchOS 10 we're now on the Apple Watch and you'll be surprised by how complete our app on your wrist is ��
- Dark mode support
- Sync support - both with iCloud and Tasks Cloud. By default it all syncs with iCloud and Tasks Cloud is opt in only.
- Biometric lock on projects - Face ID and Touch ID.
- Support for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and the Mac!
​
There are a few other things but we'll give your eyes a break. Thank you for reading and have a really good time. Welcome to Tasks and we really hope to elevate your producitivity!
​
Fin.
