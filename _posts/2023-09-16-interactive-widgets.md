# Interactive Widgets

Apple introduced interactive widgets and now our widgets are more powerfull than ever!
​
We love widgets a lot and have put in care and attention into crafting them for you. We have the following widget options:
​
- Tasks within a Project
   - Home Screen (all sizes supported)
   - Lock Screen (medium size)
   - StandBy
   - Apple Watch
- Smart Lists & Filters
   - Home Screen (all sizes supported)
   - Lock Screen (medium size)
   - StandBy
   - Apple Watch (only Today and Scheduled)
- Tags, Statuses, Tasks Types and Priorities
   - Home Screen (all sizes)
   - Lock Screen (small size)
   - StandBy

​
## Project Widget
​
This is the first option you see when adding our widgets. Once you add this widget you get the following options that you can customise:
​
- Project - select the project and you'll see tasks from it.
- Filter by tags - select the tags you wish to filter the tasks in the widget by.
- Must contain all tags - you can turn this condition as you prefer.

---
​
For example this is how you' would setup a widget to see all tasks in Project `Work` where tags can be either `#marketing` **or** `#design`
​
Project - `Work`
​
Filter by tags - `#marketing`, `#design`
​
Must contain all tags - Switch would be off (because we said marketing or design and not both)
​
> Our large widget size has a special ability to be able to move between statuses of your project, you can tap the `All` button right next to the project name to switch it to your first column tasks only and tap that to continuously switch across all the statuses and it will circle back to `All`.
​
## Smart Lists & Filters
​
If you want to see tasks from our predefined filters or your configured Smart Lists, you can. Scroll to the widgets that read `Smart Lists & Filters` and select the widget size you prefer. Once you do, just tap on the widget to edit it and you'll see the following:
​
- Show Smart Lists
   - If this is on you'll see - `Select Smart List`
   - If this is off you'll see - `Filters`
​
## Tags, Statuses, Tasks Types and Priorities
​
If you want a widget to show you just the count of a status(column) or the pending tasks of a tag, priority or task type, this widget is for you.
​
You head to adding the widget, you'll see this right at the end and may tap it to add it to your device. Long press and tap the widget to edit it and you'll be able to select the item you want to show on the widget. Tapping on this widget opens right to the item that you selected!
