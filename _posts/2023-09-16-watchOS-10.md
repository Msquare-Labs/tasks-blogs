## Onboarding
â€‹
Sign up is extremely simple, just tap Sign in with Apple button and you're in. If you have existing projects synced with Tasks Cloud on your iPhone, iPad or Mac, they appear on the Watch within seconds! If you don't have any existing projects, just try out our Sample Project or create your own Project.

## Projects
â€‹
A card with a gradient that has your picked color for the project along with a preview of your upcoming tasks of that project so you don't have to go into the detail screen unless you need to.
â€‹
You then see two buttons a `+` icon on the right to quickly add a task to that project and a `Â·Â·Â·` icon to perform two actions, Edit and Delete.
â€‹

## Scheduled
â€‹
We understand the Watch is a place where you would neccessarily go to quickly see what you need to complete and get on top of that. Hence the scheduled section to see your upcoming tasks. Tasks here are arranged in the order of the due date field within them.

## Project Detail Screen
â€‹
### Columns
â€‹
Swipe horizontal for statuses(columns) and scroll vertically to see more tasks in your project. It is just that simple. Swiping all the way to the last column will allow you to add more statuses to that project.
â€‹
### Filters
â€‹
Finding tasks on the Watch can be hard because you can only see so much at a time. You can tap the Filter icon on the top right and quickly filter out your tasks from that project to get just the things you need. For example, you are at your local grocery store and use the tag `#groceries`. You can quickly filter the list with that tag and see just the tasks you need to.
â€‹
> You can filter by tags, priorities, task types and even collaborators
â€‹
Do you want to see all tasks assigned to you which are tagged as bugs and have a high priority? You can with 3 taps ðŸ¤¯
